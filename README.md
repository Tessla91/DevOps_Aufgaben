This repository includes all steps of analyzing the mushroom-dataset of 1987 using modern machine learning techniques. Most of the data exploration, model training and fitting is done in python files. However, there are two Jupyter notebooks included in this repository. They both contain no other code then the one used in the files.

# Installing Python

For this repository, python code was used in all steps. Please install python software on your device or the virtual environment (see below) to run this repository.

## Visual Studio Code

This repository is optimized for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is a great code editor for many languages like Python and Javascript. The [introduction videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) explain how to work with VS Code.

## Development Setup

Open the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and run the setup script for your OS (see below). This will install a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with all packages specified in `requirements.txt`.

### Linux and Mac Users

1. run the setup script: `./setup.sh` or `sh setup.sh`
2. activate the python environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. run example code: `python src/hello.py`
4. install new dependency: `pip install -U scikit-learn`
5. save current installed dependencies back to requirements.txt: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

### Windows Users

1. run the setup script `.\setup.ps1`
2. activate the python environment: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
3. run example code: `python src/hello.py`
4. install new dependency: `pip install sklearn`
5. save current installed dependencies back to requirements.txt: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

Troubleshooting:

- If your system does not allow to run powershell scripts, try to set the execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`, see https://www.stanleyulili.com/powershell/solution-to-running-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system-error-on-powershell/
- If you still cannot run the setup.ps1 script, open it and copy all the commands step by step in your terminal and execute each step
